# Cubic-Weight-Challenge
I created an Android App for my implementation of the air con cubic weight challenge.
I used Kotlin as the language.

The apk file can be downloaded at /app/release/kogan-air-con-challenge-app.apk which can then be directly installed on to a device.

Alternativaely this repo can be cloned to Android Studio and run on a device from there.
